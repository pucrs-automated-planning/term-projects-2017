￼￼Controls and Interaction
Controls
The controls for 15 Days are intuitive. Almost the entire game is controlled using
the mouse. Only a few functions require the additional use of the keyboard. It isn’t possible to control the game solely using the keyboard, or by the sole use of either a joystick or a joypad.
Keyboard Commands
Esc Opens the game’s Main Menu. Space Bar Shows on-screen help.
Pressing the space bar will highlight the interactive areas of the screen, inclu- ding exits, objects that can be observed and picked up, and people that can be conversed with.
Mouse Pointer (Cursor)
In order to carry out actions within the game, move the mouse pointer onto a part of the screen and click on it with the left mouse button. If some kind of interaction is possible at a location on the screen, then this
is what we call a hotspot - an interactive area within the game environment. The mouse pointer will change to indicate this.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼11
￼￼Actions Menu
When you click on a hotspot, an Actions Menu will open, giving you options as to how
you can interact
with it. Click on
one of the availa- ble options with the mouse.
The Action Menu for any given hotspot will change automati- cally according to the situation
in your inventory. Additional actions may be made available to you when you have a certain
object in your inventory.
Standard Cursor
By left-clicking any- where on the screen, the character will move
to the selected point.
Direction Cursor
Left-clicking on this icon with the mouse will show a new
camera angle in the current scene, possibly revealing new
items or areas of interest.
Exit
into another scene.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Left-clicking on this icon with the mouse will move the character

Exiting
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼from the Detailed View Shows where you can exit a detailed view.
￼￼13
￼￼Function Hub
The Function Hub is a round control element which is always shown in the bottom left of the screen. Via the Function Hub you can access the map, the inventory and the most important menu functions.
Map
are reachable via the map and these are shown and active. By clicking on a symbol, you can go directly to the corresponding place in the game world.
Inventory Bar
When you pick up an object in the game, it will be placed into your Inventory. This is where all of the objects you have picked up will go, ready to be used. To display the inventory, move the mouse pointer over the right hand edge
of the Function Hub. To scroll through all the objects in your inventory, move the mouse over the right or left edge of the bar. Here you‘ll find arrows which allow you to see more items in your inventory.
In the circle of the Function Hub is a map and a symbol – this symbol shows your present location in the game. When you click on the circle, the map will open. Symbols of places you have already visited
￼￼￼￼14
￼￼Menu Functions in the Function Hub
When you move your mouse over the upper edge of the Function Hub, the following three options will appear on the left edge of the game screen: Main Menu, Save and Load. Each of these is activated by a mouse click.
Using Objects
To use an object from the inventory, left-click on it with the mouse. This will open an Action menu (see above) which will show possible actions inside the inventory.
If an action is possible inside the scene,
you will also be able to see this from the action menu at the corresponding hotspot
in the scene. If you have the appropriate object with you, then the action menu will automatically show you the possible interaction with it.
Combining Objects
Certain objects can be used to- gether, for example; a new object can be made by combining two
others, putting one object inside another, etc. You can make this happen by taking
an object ’in your hand’ in the inventory and then clicking it on another object within the scene or the inventory.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼15
￼￼￼Dialogue
In the course of the game you will meet over twenty interac- tive characters. It is possible to
converse with these people. You can recognise the ‘talkability’ of a character by seeing that when you
move the mouse pointer over one of these characters, it changes into a speech bubble. When you
click on the character, the conver- sation will begin.
Symbols may appear at the bottom edge of the screen. Select a symbol from those available using the mouse. Your character will speak and the other character will reply. After this it’s possible
that new symbols will appear for your character.
New Situations – new conversations
Depending on the game situation, the time of day, or the day itself, new options or completely new conversations can become available. It can be worthwhile to go back to ‘talkable’ characters, or to phone them up if you
get the impression that things might have changed in the course of the game.
Aborting Dialogue and Real-time movies
In 15 Days each individual dialogue
is treated technically
as a short film which is played back in real-time. There is the
opportunity to skip
these sequences by
pressing the Esc key. Upon pressing the Esc key, a warning message
will appear in the middle of the screen. Press the key again to confirm the action and skip the whole sequence. Doing this is not
￼￼￼￼￼16
￼￼recommended however, as the game will be harder to solve if you skip information and clues from the characters.
Computer and Cell-phone
Ryzoom
Ryzoom is an online data-bank in which you can do some research as the game progresses (in various places in the plot you will have to use it) when you need some background information. This research will take
place at the computer.
Click on any computer in the game and the desktop will be displayed. You will see icons for applications and the icon for the Ryzoom browser.
Click on this icon and Ryzoom’s start page will load up. You can now enter your search terms into the box at the top of the screen. You can begin your search by pressing the Return key.
Ryzoom will display a list of search results, some of them relevant, others less so. Click on any result to investigate it in more detail. Some Ryzoom pages are linked to one another: You can click on links at the end of the text to lead you further, just like the Internet.
￼￼￼￼17
￼￼￼￼￼Reading Emails
You will see an icon on Jack Stern’s desktop which opens an email program. In the program, you will see a list of the emails which have been received. Click an email to read it. Attachments such as
files can be opened and viewed by clicking on them. New emails are added to the list automatically. You can close the window again by clicking the ‘X’ icon, as in a typical Windows interface.
Telephoning
To make a phone call, go to the inventory and left-click the tele- phone. There you will see various characters who you can call.
￼￼￼￼
Important Advice: Take care with your spel- ling – Ryzoom doesn’t correct typos and er- rors will inevitably lead to your receiving a wrong result!
￼The Game
Story and Main Characters
Cathryn Hope and her two partners-in-crime Mike Mensforth and Bernard Dewaele are three young art thieves who exploit the astronomical prices of the international art black market in order to pursue their own idealistic aims. Their idea is simple,
if not a stroke of genius: In various cloak-and-dagger operations they break in unnoticed into art galleries and museums. There they exchange priceless originals for worthless copies, carefully created by their old friend the emeritus art professor Robert McBride. They then sell their stolen goods quietly to rather dubious and eccentric art collectors, and anonymously donate the enormous profits they make from this discrete trade to charitable organisations and worthy development pro- jects. At the start of the game the three art thieves are in something of an upbeat mood – their last job in Johannesburg, South Africa was a complete success and furthermore, it’s also Cathryn’s birthday. Mike and Bernard have
come up with a special surprise for her...
￼￼￼￼￼19
￼
￼￼￼Cathryn Hope
Cathryn is the group’s leader. She is charismatic, adventurous and optimistic. With her cool nerve and amazing climbing ability, she leads the break-ins.
Cathryn is a diehard optimist: she steals from the rich, not for personal gain; instead she distributes her wealth Robin Hood-style.
Bernard Dewaele
Bernard is the planner in the background. His official job is as an art expert for a London insurance company. He used to lead a double-life
working as a lone art thief, but since he’s got to know Cathryn, he has left it to her to carry out the break-ins.
Mike Mensforth
Mike is the guy for anything technical: He is a computer geek who can crack any code and hack unnoticed into any network. He helps
out his partners with their break-ins with his homemade tech devices. Along with all this he also carries out the computer research
for the thefts. In day-to-day life Mike has something of a tendency to overestimate his capabilities – this makes him sometimes a
little difficult to get on with.
Special Agent Jack Stern
Jack is a brilliant but unconventional US Investigator, who doesn’t seem to care about rules and regulations. His boss
hates him for it, but his successes have proved this loner individualist to be right, over and over again. Jack is sent over
to England by the International Police in order to investigate a puzzling death.

￼￼￼￼From this departure point an exciting, atmospheric parallel plot unfolds in which you constantly and quite abruptly have to keep switching between the two fronts: In the role of three criminals you have to plot some devious plans, while as a US investiga- tor, it‘s your job to shed light on a puzzling mess of art theft and political murder.
Tips for your Game Strategy
The Basics
15 days is an adventure game. Important here are your powers of observation, attentiveness, imagination, empathy and combining abilities. Wherever you go: look at everything carefully. Give yourself time. Investigate the world in which you find yourself. Even seemingly insignificant details can be important.
Speak to people
Some characters won’t be all that free with their information; some will demand favours, or ask you for something. Speak to them though to find out what they want. It’s completely possible that some characters have answers ready for you – or that thanks to the changing game situation, new questions have become available for you to ask them.
Don’t give up
Don’t worry about trying anything, just give it a go. There is always a way out. There really are only just a few places where you can get yourself into a dange- rous situation.
Save your games
Save your game often. It’s particularly sensible to save when you get the feeling that a difficult situation is about to come up, or when you’ve just overcome a tough obstacle, or if you have just acquired a new object which was difficult to get hold of.

￼￼If you’re not getting anywhere...
Think carefully about your situation. What is your present goal? Which objects do you have, which do you need? Where have you been already, where haven’t you been yet? Who might be able to help you? Are you really sure you haven’t
overlooked something? How are your main characters doing? What are their main concerns? Think about the ‘Space Bar’ too, you can use this to bring up help at the most important places in a scene. But watch out: You‘ll ruin the fun
of searching and puzzling things out if you all too quickly resort to using this help wherever you can. Adventure games are the most fun when you come across the solutions yourself.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼22
￼But if you get really desperate: There is always someone who knows the solution. When nothing else works: swap your experiences with other players! Or describe your problem on our forums: http://forum.dtp-entertainment.com
