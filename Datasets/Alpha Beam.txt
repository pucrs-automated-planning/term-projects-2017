Alpha Beam With Ernie is an edutainment video game released for the Atari 2600 by Atari in 1983.[2] It was developed in conjunction with the Children's Computer Workshop. The game was programmed by Michael Callahan and Preston Stuart.[3]

Gameplay
The object of Alpha Beam is to help Sesame Street's Ernie pilot a small shuttle, collect fuel tanks (marked by a letter of the alphabet), and return them to his space ship so that he can return to Earth.

The game was marketed as a family-friendly game that could teach children pre-reading skills such as identifying and matching letters. Alpha Beam was compatible with the Atari Kid's Controller, which was sold separately, although the regular keyboard controller is also compatible.[4]
