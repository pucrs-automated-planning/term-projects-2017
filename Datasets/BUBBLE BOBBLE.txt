￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Move Bub (player 1) and Bob
(player 2) around the screen
and encase enemy beasties in
your bubbles. Once you've
trapped an enemy inside a bubble, pop the bubble to finish off the foe. Defeat all on-screen enemies to proceed to the next round. You will lose a life if
you are touched by an enemy or enemy attack. Lose all your lives and it will be game over.
Teamwork is crucial to succeeding in two-player games, so be sure to work with your partner to take down all the enemies.
● Continuing
After your game ends, the game over screen will be displayed. Press START to return to the
mode selection screen. Select 1P CONTINUE or 2P CONTINUE and confirm with START. You can continue your game from any round you previously reached by selecting it with A or B and confirming with START.
● Adding a Second Player
If a second player wants to join in the action
during a single-player game, press START on the first player's controller to pause the game, then press SELECT. Player 1 will have to give up one life to bring Bob (player 2) into the game as a teammate.
● Reviving Your Teammate
If one of the two players runs out of lives and
drops out of a two-player game before the other player, the remaining player can give up a remaining life to bring the fallen teammate back into the game using the method described
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼previously.
