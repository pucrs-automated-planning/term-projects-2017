￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼In this action adventure game, take on the role of Simon Belmont on his quest to uncover Count Dracula's five missing body parts. Once you find these gruesome items, proceed to Dracula's castle, where you'll again duel to the death with the count. But heed the warnings of others and find the Cross before entering his domain.
This quest won't be easy, for you must battle hideous fiends who stalk the land. Fortunately, the longer you survive, the greater your experience rating, and the stronger your vulnerable soul will become.
Hints to help you on your adventure can be found as you wander around Transylvania. Stop and talk to the townspeople for helpful clues which will help you on your quest. You will also find merchants who'll sell you weapons and other mystical items. Your purchasing power depends on how many hearts you've collected during your confrontations with Count Dracula's minions.
Another warning: some of the townspeople are pranksters, and will give Simon falsified information. Of course, you'll never know which of the townspeople are pranksters until you take a chance...
● High Noon
Visit towns during the day to
visit merchants' stores and
churches. Talk to the
townspeople to hear
important bits of information. Enemies can be
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼found on the outskirts of a town.
● Night-Time
Townspeople are
conspicuously absent during
the night, and stores and
churches are closed.
Enemies are also more powerful at night, and as a result you gain more experience points and hearts when you defeat them.
● Game Over
You will lose a life when your health meter
depletes fully or when you fall into water. Lose all of your lives and it will be game over.
