￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ Basic Play
￼￼Make your way through the
three stages while avoiding the
various enemies and barrels
heading your way.
Clear stages one and two by working your way up to Pauline on the top floor, and stage three by walking over the top of all the bolts located throughout the stage.
You will lose a life if you touch an enemy/barrel, the bonus time reaches zero or you fall from too high a ledge. Lose all of your lives and it will be game over.
