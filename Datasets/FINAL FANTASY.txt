￼ Classes
There are six classes. Each has its own abilities
and can use class-specific items, such as different types of weapon and armour.
￼￼￼￼￼Fighter
￼￼￼￼￼￼Red Mage
￼￼￼Fighters are professional soldiers hardened after years of training. Extensive weapons training lets them equip almost anything.
￼￼￼￼￼￼Thief
￼￼￼￼￼The agile thief is an expert at both quick attacks and tactical retreats, but lacks resilience.
￼￼￼￼￼￼Black Belt
￼￼￼The master of martial arts is both mentally and physically tough, fighting effectively with both bare hands and martial arts weapons.
￼￼￼￼White Mage
￼￼￼￼￼These mages can heal wounds and cast protective spells. Their offensive spells are focused on obliterating the undead.
￼￼￼￼Black Mage
￼￼￼Black Mages have the ability to unleash powerful elemental spells
which can attack, debilitate and disable entire legions.
￼￼￼A jack of all trades, the Red Mage has limited training in white and black magic, along with some
weapons training.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Control the four characters and journey around the world, restoring light to your four mystical orbs. In general, you'll rely on three screens: the map screen, the menu screen and the battle screen.
● Map Screen
This is the main game screen. It shows various types of terrain, including populated areas.
Move your party around the map to visit towns and castles, trek through forests and swamps, and traverse many other areas. Talk to everyone you see and fight lots of monsters to get more experience!
● Menu Screen
Press START on the map
screen to go to the menu
screen, where you can
change your equipment,
check out your characters' stats and use your items or magic.

while adventuring, the action plays out here.
