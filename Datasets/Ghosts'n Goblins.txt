￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼You play the role of a knight who must fight against zombies, demons and other
undead creatures to save the
kidnapped princess. Defeat the boss at the end of each stage, then use the key that drops to open the gate and proceed to the next stage.
● Armour
If you are hit by an enemy or
enemy projectile, you will
lose your armour. You will
lose a life if you take a
second hit, fall into a pit or run out of time. If
you lose a life, you will have to start over at the beginning of the stage or at the halfway point if
you managed to reach it.
● Game Over
Lose all of your lives and it will be game over. If
you lose all of your lives, you can always continue the game by selecting CONTINUE on the title screen.
