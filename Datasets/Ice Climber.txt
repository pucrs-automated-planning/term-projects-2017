￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼The aim of the game is to use
your hammer to destroy blocks
and defeat enemies while
climbing the eight floors of
each of the 32 mountains until you reach their
peak.
However, do your best to stay on the screen and try to avoid being hit by enemies and falling ice shards, as failure to do so will result in you losing a life. If you run out of lives completely, it will be game over.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Time Limit
After scaling the full eight floors of the mountain you will enter a bonus stage. Work your way to the top of the mountain, where you must then jump up, and grab onto the condor flying overhead. Don't forget to pick up the various vegetables lying scattered around to help increase your bonus score. Keep an eye out for the ears of corn as the first one you collect will grant you an extra life. However, be aware as this all must be done within the specified time limit. The bonus stage will end if you run out of time, fall off the bottom of the screen or if you successfully grab onto the condor. Your score will then be calculated, before proceeding on to the next stage.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼6 2 Player Game
￼￼By selecting 2 PLAYER GAME, it is possible to play the game
with two players. You can either work together to climb the
mountain, or race each other to the peak as rivals. However, please note that as you progress through the floors the screen will shift up along with the player. Be careful not to disappear off the screen as doing so will result in a lost life.
