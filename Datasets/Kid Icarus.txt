￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Guide Pit in his quest to find
the three sacred treasures and
free Angel Land from the terror
of Medusa. Once you recover
all three treasures, you will go to the Palace in the Sky and duel with Medusa herself. Along the way, you'll travel through several exciting and dangerous worlds while fighting against fierce enemies. Each time an enemy hits you, you lose health. When your health is fully depleted, your game will end. You can also lose by falling off the screen, so jump carefully.
To bring up the pause screen press START. When the screen appears, you can check your items, score and other information.
