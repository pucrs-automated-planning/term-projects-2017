￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼● Map and Stage Information There are numerous doors
on the map screen which will take you through to the
individual stages of that
level. After clearing a stage
the map screen will grow
larger and reveal new doors
to enter through.
Defeat the boss lying in wait
on the final stage of each
level and grab the Star Rod piece to proceed on to the next. You must defeat all eight bosses to clear the game!
● Losing Lives
Your health meter will
deplete if you are hit by an
enemy or enemy attack. If
your health meter depletes
completely or you fall off of
the screen, you will lose a life. Lose all of your lives and it will be game over.
On the game over screen select CONTINUE to restart the current stage, or select GAME END to return to the title screen.

● Discarding Copied Abilities You will lose your copied
ability if you are hit by an
