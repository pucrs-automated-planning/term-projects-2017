￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Take on the role of Mega Man, the original humanoid battle robot. It is your task to prevent Dr. Wily's latest plans for world domination from coming to fruition, by battling with his eight newly deployed robot minions. Traverse through each stage, then overcome his fortress by taking out all those standing in your way, before entering into a final showdown with Dr. Wily himself.
Use  on the stage selection
screen to choose a stage, and
then confirm with START.
You will only be able to access Dr. Wily's stage after all of the eight other stages have been cleared.
● Losing Lives and Game Over
You will lose a life if your life energy gauge fully
depletes, you fall into a pit or you fail to avoid certain in-game obstacles. Lose all of your lives and it will be game over.
♦ You can check how many remaining lives you have left on the second page of the weapon selection screen.

￼￼Acquire these special weapons by defeating each of the eight stage bosses. Defeating some of these bosses will let you acquire special items that will help you overcome many obstacles.

Man's default weapon, the Mega Buster, does not deplete with use and can be used as much as you like.
