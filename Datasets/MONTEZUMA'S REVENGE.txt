 MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE (Featuring Panama Joe)

 BY PARKER BROTHERS

 PANAMA JOE.  That's what they call him 'round these parts;  though no
 one knows his real name or where he comes from.  But one thing's for
 sure, PANAMA JOE's a daredevil from the word "go!"  No risk's too
 great if the reward's large enough.  Winning.  That's what's most
 important to him.  And more times than not, that's exactly what he
 does.  Because he's tough, clever and resourceful.   And sometimes,
 downright pig-headed!  Though occasionally (ah-hum), he's been known
 to get in over his head.  Luckily, he's got a knack for getting
 himself out of hot water as quickly as he gets into it!  Let's hope
 MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE is one of those times.

 OBJECT

 To help PANAMA JOE safely reach Montezuma's fantastic treasure by
 guiding him through a maze of death-dealing chambers within the
 emperor's fortress.

 Along the way, PANAMA JOE must avoid an array of deadly creatures
 while he collects valuables and other tools which can aid him in
 mastering the evils of the fortress and escaping with the loot!

 THE JOYSTICK

 Plug the joystick controller into JACK #1.  use your joystick to move

 left or right, move the joystick in those directions.  To make him
 climb up a ladder or chain, push forwards on the joystick; to climb
 down, pull backwards on the joystick.

 NOTE:  you'll discover that a combination of left/right and
 backwards/forwards joystick movements will make guiding PANAMA JOE on
 and off ladders and chains easier.

 THE FIRE BUTTON

 Press the FIRE button any time you want PANAMA JOE to jump.  If
 PANAMA JOE is standing still, he will jump up and down.  Ig he is
 moving left or right, PANAMA JOE will leap in that direction.

 SCREEN DISPLAYS

 In the upper left-hand corner of the screen there is a box called the
 INVENTORY WINDOW.  Each time PANAMA JOE collects a special tool
 (e.g., sword, torch or key,) that tool is displayed in the Inventory
 Window until he finishes using it.

 At the bottom of the Inventory Window are 5 hats representing your
 remaining number of PANAMA JOEs.  Each time you lose a PANAMA JOE,
 one hat dissapears from the Inventory Window.  You'll begin the game
 with 6 PANAMA JOEs, including the one on the screen.  If you
 accumulate more than 6 PANAMA JOEs, extra hats are displayed below
 your score.

 The number to the immediate right of the Inventory Window indicates
 the game level currently being played.

 In the upper right-hand corner of the screen is the SCORE BOX.

 be displayed in this space.  (see SCORING section)

 PLAYING

 Once your start this game, you ARE PANAMA JOE - winding your way
 through MONTEZUMA's fortress!  That's mean you've got to be ready to
 handle lots of action.  Like climbing ladders and chans.  Sliding
 down poles.  Jumping over (and under) deadly creatures.  And grabbing
 precious jewels an special tools along the way.  No sweat, right?
 You'll probably be ready for anything because, like PANAMA JOE, you
 thrive on the spirit of adventure and exploration.  Maybe you'll need
 to backtrack through certain chambers.  Or perhaps forge ahead
 blindly.  Even test your memory to remember the location of a room
 you fought through earlier.  Just be sure to keep a cool head.  use
 your special tools wisely.And please - try not to let greed blind you
 as you snatch up MONTEZUMA's fabulous treasures.  Happy hunting,
 PANAMA JOE!

 INSIDE MONTEZUMA'S FORTRESS

 As you guide PANAMA JOE through Montezuma's fortress, you'll
 encounter 3 major groups of elements.  They are:

 - Room Fixtures
 - Killer Creatures
 - Special Tools & Rewards

 Various combinations of these elements are found in all the chambers
 throughout the fortress.  Each is described as follows:

 ROOM FIXTURES

 Laser Gates - Destructive laser gates intermittently appear and
 disappear in various parts of a chamber.  PANAMA JOE must avoid these
 gates, and pass through ONLY when they disappear.  IF PANAMA JOE HIT
 A LASER GATE, YOU LOSE HIM.

 Conveyor Belts - Conveyor belts force PANAMA JOE to speed up or slow
 down, depending on the direction in which he is moving.  In general,
 if you move the joystick IN THE DIRECTION OPPOSITE to which the
 conveyor belt is moving, PANAMA JOE will slow down while moving
 against the conveyor.  If PANAMA JOE is heading in the SAME DIRECTION
 as the conveyor, he will speed across to the other side where, at
 times, you must safely jump him off.  IF PANAMA JOE MISSES JUMPING
 ONTO OR OFF OF AN ELEVATED CONVEYOR BELT AND FALLS TOO FAR, YOU LOSE
 HIM.

 Disappearing Floors - In some chambers, there are certain sections of
 the floor which look different from the rest.  These sections
 intermittently appear and disappear.  You must time PANAMA JOE's
 crossing of these sections just right or...IF THE FALL'S TOO GREAT,
 OR THERE IS A FIRE PIT BELOW HIM, YOU LOSE THAT PANAMA JOE.

 Doors - Throughout the fortress you'll encounter 3 different colored
 doors: red, blue, and grey.  These doors can ONLY be opened when
 PANAMA JOE approaches them with the corresponding color key.
 (Displayed in the Inventory Window)  YOU GAIN 300 POINTS FOR OPENEING
 ANY DOOR.

 Fire Pits - Occasionally, PANAMA JOE will come across a blazing fire
 pit as he maneuvers through a chamber.  Fire pits must be avoided at
 all costs!  Guide PANAMA JOE around them, or jump over them whenever
 possible.  IF PANAMA JOE FALLS INTO THE FLAMES, YOU'LL LOSE HIM TO A
 PUFF OF SMOKE.

 Ladders - Ladders allow PANAMA JOE to travel up to, or down from one
 level to the next.  Simply move the joystick in the appropriate
 direction.  PANAMA JOE CANNOT JUMP ONTO, OR OFF OF A LADDER.

 Poles - Poles allow PANAMA JOE to slide DOWN ONLY from one level to
 the next.  Simply jump PANAMA JOE onto a pole - he'll handle the
 rest.  BUT IF PANAMA JOE MISSES THE POLE AND FALLS, YOU LOSE HIM.

 Chains - Much like ladders, chains offer PANAMA JOE a way to travel
 from one level to the next.  Simply jump PANAMA JOE onto a chain, and
 guide him up or down using your joystick.

 KILLER CREATURES

 Skulls - In his travales, PANAMA JOE will come across bouncing and
 rolling skulls. he must jump over the rolling skulls, and walk under
 the bouncing ones.  IF PANAMA JOE IS HIT BY A SKULL, YOU LOSE HIM.
 But, if he has a sword (displayed in the Inventory Window), PANAMA
 JOE can eliminate a skull by simply walking through it.  YOU GAIN
 2000 POINTS FOR ELIMINATING A SKULL.

 Snakes - Watch out for snakes!  Though they don’t move, they have a
 deadly bite.  Whenever PANAMA JOE meets up with one, he must jump
 over it.  Not even a sword will eliminate a snake.  IF PANAMA JOE IS
 BITTEN, YOU LOSE HIM.

 Spiders - Unlike snakes, spiders do get around.  They’ll even climb
 ladders!  IF ONE BITES PANAMA JOE, YOU LOSE HIM. So PANAMA JOE muset
 either jump over spiders, or slay them with a sword (displayed in the
 Inventory Window). YOU’LL GAIN 3000 POINTS FOR SLAYING A SPIDER.

 SPECIAL TOOLS & REWARDS

 As PANAMA JOE works his way through the fortress, he’ll encounter
 special tools and rewards - all there for his taking.  When possible,
 PANAMA JOE should jump up and grab a special item, which will
 then be displayed in the Inventory Window until it is used.  The
 Inventory Window can only hold 5 items at a time.  Once it’s filled,
 PANAMA JOE cannot collect any more special items.

 The 5 special tools and rewards are:

 Amulets - These hammer shaped objects help PANAMA JOE evade
 killer creatures.  Whenever he grabs an amulet, all killer creatures
 turn grey and are disabled for several seconds - allowing PANAMA
 JOE to safely walk through them.  he can even travel into another
 chamber during this time.  Once this time is up, the amulet will
 disappear from the Inventory Window and the killer creatures will
 return to their nasty, normal-colored selves.  COLLECTING AN
 AMULET IS WORTH 100 POINTS.

 Jewels - These dazzling beauties are worth 1000 points apiece!
 PANAMA JOE simply jumps up and plucks them as he goes by.  However,
 if the Inventory Window contains 5 items, PANAMA JOE cannot collect
 more jewels - even though the jewels are not displayed in the window.

 Keys - To every red, blue, or grey door in the fortress - there’s a
 matching key.  A door can only be opened with the correct
 corresponding key which PANAMA JOE must grab along the way.  Keys
 will be displayed in the Inventory Window until used.  YOU GAIN 300
 POINTS FOR OPENING A DOOR.

 Swords - A SWORD IN THE HAND IS WORTH 50 POINTS - so be sure not to
 pass up too many of them along the way.  More important, a sword
 enables PANAMA JOE to eliminate spiders and skulls on contact.

 Torches - Don't underestimate the necessity of a torch.  As PANAMA
 JOE travels deeper onto the fortress, he may encounter dark chambers.
 Only with the torch can he illuminate these hazarddous rooms.  Once
 PANAMA JOE has a torch, he keeps it throughout the current game
 level.  Without a torch, there is no light at all - and you must rely
 on your memory to guide

 PANAMA JOE safely through these chambers.  GRABBING A TORCH EARNS YOU
 3000 POINTS.

 THE TREASURE ROOM

 If PANAMA JOE safely navigates through all of the chambers in the
 fortress, he'll eventually reach his ultimate goal - The Treasure
 Chamber.  Herin lies the fabulous treasure of the emperor, Montezuma.
 To enter this final chamber, daredevil PANAMA JOE must leap into the
 darkness!  Once inside, he'll find several chains - and the infamous
 jewels - all awaiting his grasp.. In just a few seconds, PANAMA JOE
 must jump from chain to chain trying to collect as amny jewels as
 possible.  But Beware!  If PANAMA JOE misses a chain and jumps onto a
 pole, he immediatly slides to the next Difficulty Level and misses
 the chance to collect more jewels.  When time's up, you'll
 automatically advance to the next Difficulty Level.

 END OF GAME

 The game ends when you have lost all of your PANAMA JOEs.  When this
 happens, PANAMA JOE will disappear and the action on the screen will
 stop.  If the game ends while playing Difficulty Level #1, simply
 press the FIRE button on the joystick controller.  You'll receive 6
 PANAMA JOEs and begin the action (with a score of zero) at the same
 point at which the game ended.  Refer to SETTING THE CONSOLE CONTROLS
 section for starting a new game.
