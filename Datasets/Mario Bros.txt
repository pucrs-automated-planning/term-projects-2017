￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Punch the ground beneath an
enemy to knock them onto their
backs, and then run up and
kick them while they are down
to finish them off. Defeat a set number of enemies to progress on to the next phase.
You will lose a life if you touch an enemy. Lose all of your lives and it will be game over.
♦ For every 20,000 points accumulated you will gain an extra life.
