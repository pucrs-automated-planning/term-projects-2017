￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼As the hero, Samus, your job is
to infiltrate the fortress planet
Zebes and destroy Mother
Brain. Use all of your special
abilities to fight your way though each of the areas as you conduct your search. Look for items hidden throughout Zebes to power up. Some of these items will give you new abilities or attacks, allowing you to gain entry to areas of Zebes that were previously inaccessible.

enemy, enemy attack or fail to
avoid certain hazards, you will
take damage and a portion of
your energy will be consumed. When your energy reaches zero, one of your energy tanks will be consumed. If you lose all of your energy and have no energy tanks remaining, it will be game over.
