PAC-MAN
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼￼Guide Pac-Man through the maze and eat all the Pac-Dots to clear the stage. If a ghost catches you, you lose a life, and when you run out of lives,
your game ends. By eating Pac-Dots, Power Pellets, fruits and ghosts, you can build up your score, and in-turn your number of lives.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Use Warp Tunnels to travel to the other side of the maze.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼5 Power Pellets
￼￼If you eat a Power Pellet, the ghosts will weaken for a little bit, and you'll be able to eat them. Eating consecutive ghosts will boost your score. Ghosts that have been eaten will return to the centre of the screen and reappear in their normal state.
♦ Ghosts that have not been eaten will return to normal once the Power Pellet wears off, so be careful.
