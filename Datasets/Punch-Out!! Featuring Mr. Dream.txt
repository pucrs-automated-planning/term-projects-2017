￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Take control of Little Mac and
battle for titles as a pro boxer.
Each match consists of three
rounds, lasting three minutes.
K.O. your opponent, or knock him to the floor three times in a single round (T.K.O.) to win and progress to the next fight. If you and your opponent are both standing when the bell goes, then victory will be determined by points, but the
judges aren't too keen on Little Mac!
● If You Lose...
If you lose a total of three matches it will be
game over. Also, if you lose certain matches your ranking will also go down.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼5 Punching and Stamina
￼￼Punching
Little Mac has four types of
punch at his disposal.
However, each time one of
his punches misses its mark,
or he is struck by his
opponent, he will lose some
hearts. When all the hearts are gone, he will be unable to attack for a short period of time, so be sure to dodge effectively and restore lost hearts.
 Uppercuts
If you have at least one ☆,
Little Mac will launch an
uppercut when you press
START. Increase the number
of ☆ by hitting your
opponent with certain
attacks. However, you will lose a ☆ every time
your opponent's blow connects, and if you are knocked down or the round ends, you will lose all your ☆.
Stamina
Stamina will go down every
time Little Mac is punched,
and he will be knocked to
the ground when stamina
reaches zero. If you can't
get him back on his feet
before the referee counts to ten, he will be knocked out. If knocked down, tap A and B repeatedly to get back up.
