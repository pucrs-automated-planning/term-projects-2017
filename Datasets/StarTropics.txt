￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Introduction
￼￼Help Mike, a 15-year-old star pitcher from Seattle, navigate his way through the islands of the Coral Sea to find his abducted uncle, Dr. Jones.
You'll need all of Mike's abilities to defeat enemies, save his uncle, and solve the mystery of the Lost Ruins. If you come into contact with an enemy or trap, your Life Hearts will decrease by a certain amount. If you lose all of your Life Hearts, fall victim to certain traps or fall in the water, you will lose a life. The adventure will end when you lose all of your lives.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼4 Story
￼￼Hi. My name is Michael Jones, but my friends call me Mike. I'm fifteen years old, and I live in Seattle, Washington.
Have you heard of my Uncle Steve? Well, most people don't call him that; they call him Dr. Jones. He is a very famous archaeologist who is looking for some lost ruins in the Coral Sea. I've never actually met him, but last week I received a letter from him inviting me to stay with him at his laboratory on C-Island.
I leave tomorrow on a helicopter! I bet I won't be able to sleep at all tonight. Well, good night.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼6 Basic Play
￼￼StarTropics consists of two different phases: the travel stage and the battle stage.
Travel Stage
On land, walk around and talk
to islanders to gather details
about Dr. Jones's
disappearance. Press A while
facing a person to begin a
conversation and press A again to scroll the text on the screen. Arrows indicate the islander has more to say.
When Mike is inside the super submarine, Sub-C, press B to submerge and travel from one island to the next.
♦ Mike can't use any weapons during the travel stage.
Battle Stage
When Mike enters a tunnel or a
cave, the battle stage begins.
Press START to pause the game
and then use  to choose a
weapon or a magic item. If
selecting a weapon, press START to return to the battle. If selecting a magic item, press B to use it, and then press START to return to the battle. Alternatively, you can quickly cycle through your weapons while playing by pressing SELECT.
