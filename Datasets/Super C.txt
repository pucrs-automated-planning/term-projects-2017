￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼You are tasked with eliminating
the merciless alien invaders.
Your ultimate goal is to destroy
the alien base. Make the most
of power-up items you discover as you blast your way through each area, taking out the alien invaders and avoiding obstacles in your way. You will lose a life if you are hit by an enemy or an enemy attack, or fall off screen. Lose all your lives and it will be game over. It is possible to play with two players simultaneously. Team up and head into enemy territory.
