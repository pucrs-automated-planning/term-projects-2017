￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Selecting a level panel will
automatically start that level
with the current player. To clear
a level, make it all the way to
the end and grab a card from the flashing panel. Being hit by an enemy or enemy attack, falling into a hole or running out of time will cause you to lose a life. Should you completely run out of lives then it will be game over.
♦ Should you be hit while using one of the power-ups (e.g. Fire Mario) then you will simply be returned to your normal state and will not lose a life.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼4 Map Screen
￼￼Move your character with , and when above a level panel press A to start that level.
Also, should you have found any items throughout the game or acquired any from Toad's house, you can display them with B. Select an item with  and press A to use it. You can hold a maximum of 28 items at any one time.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼7 2 Player Game
￼￼It is possible to take alternating
control of both Mario and Luigi
when playing through the
game. However, if Mario and
Luigi are both on the same action panel on the map screen, either player can start a battle by pressing A.
The aim of this battle game is to be the first to either defeat five enemies or collect five coins. You can defeat the enemies coming out of the pipes above by hitting the ground directly underneath them, and then while they lie on their back kick them to finish them off. Also, should you be able to punch the ground underneath your opponent or stomp on their head they will drop one of their cards, which you can then steal.
The winner will get to move next on the map screen (the loser will not incur any lost lives).
