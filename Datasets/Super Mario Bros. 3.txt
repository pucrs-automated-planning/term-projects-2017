Other Controls
You can defeat enemies by jumping on them or by hitting them with a shell, your tail (as Raccoon and
Tanooki Mario), with a fireball or with hammers.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Move
￼￼￼￼￼￼Jump
￼￼￼Use  to move, and B to run. Use  when in front of a vine to ascend or descend it, and  in front of a door to enter.
￼￼￼￼￼￼Crouch
￼￼￼Hold  to crouch. Also, press  on a slope to slide down (except as Frog Mario).
￼￼￼￼￼￼Enter a pipe
￼￼￼￼￼Press  when above a pipe, or  + A when below to enter.
￼￼￼￼￼￼Swim
￼Press A when underwater to swim, while using  to move in the required direction. If you press A without a direction,
Mario will rise to the surface. When playing as Frog Mario you will swim faster by holding A.
￼￼￼The longer you hold A, the higher you will jump. When in
water, press  + A to jump out.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼￼￼￼￼￼Super jump
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Transform
￼￼￼Press A just as you stomp on top of an enemy to jump extra high.
￼￼￼￼￼￼Grab/Kick
￼After stomping on a Koopa, press and hold B to grab its shell. Release B to kick the shell forwards. To grab an ice block, stand on top of it or to the side and press and hold B.
￼￼￼￼￼￼Fireball
￼￼￼￼￼Press B when playing as Fire Mario to throw a fireball.
￼￼￼￼￼￼Float down
￼￼￼While playing as Tanooki or Raccoon Mario, tap A repeatedly while descending to float slowly back down to the ground.
￼￼￼￼Tail attack
￼￼￼￼￼While playing as Tanooki or Raccoon Mario, press B to perform a tail attack. You can use this to break blocks and attack enemies.
￼￼￼￼￼￼Fly
￼While playing as Tanooki or Raccoon Mario, running with B
will cause the power meter (P) to increase. When the meter begins flashing, tap A repeatedly to take off and fly.
￼￼￼While playing as Tanooki Mario, press  + B to turn into a statue, rendering you temporarily invincible.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼2 Getting Started
￼￼Use SELECT to select between 1 PLAYER GAME and 2 PLAYER
GAME, and START to proceed to the map screen.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Selecting a level panel will
automatically start that level
with the current player. To clear
a level, make it all the way to
the end and grab a card from the flashing panel. Being hit by an enemy or enemy attack, falling into a hole or running out of time will cause you to lose a life. Should you completely run out of lives then it will be game over.
♦ Should you be hit while using one of the power-ups (e.g. Fire Mario) then you will simply be returned to your normal state and will not lose a life.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼4 Map Screen
￼￼Move your character with , and when above a level panel press A to start that level.
Also, should you have found any items throughout the game or acquired any from Toad's house, you can display them with B. Select an item with  and press A to use it. You can hold a maximum of 28 items at any one time.

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼7 2 Player Game
￼￼It is possible to take alternating
control of both Mario and Luigi
when playing through the
game. However, if Mario and
Luigi are both on the same action panel on the map screen, either player can start a battle by pressing A.
The aim of this battle game is to be the first to either defeat five enemies or collect five coins. You can defeat the enemies coming out of the pipes above by hitting the ground directly underneath them, and then while they lie on their back kick them to finish them off. Also, should you be able to punch the ground underneath your opponent or stomp on their head they will drop one of their cards, which you can then steal.
The winner will get to move next on the map screen (the loser will not incur any lost lives).
