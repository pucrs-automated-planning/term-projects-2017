Super Mario Bros.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Clear the game by grabbing on
to the pole at the end of each
area, and by defeating the
bosses lying in wait in the
deepest reaches of each world's castle.
Should you be hit by an enemy or enemy attack while playing as small Mario, fall down a hole or alternatively run out of time you will lose a life. Should you lose a life with no lives remaining then it will be game over.
