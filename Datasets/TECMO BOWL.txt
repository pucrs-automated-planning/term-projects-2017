￼￼￼￼Offence
♦ When on offence, begin play by pressing A to snap the ball from the Center to the Quarterback.
♦ You can avoid being tackled by the defence by repeatedly pressing A to break the opponent's tackle!
♦ You can choose to pass on the Formation Selection Screen. You can only pass when using a Pass formation. After the snap, you can cycle through eligible Receivers by pressing A. The Receiver with the cursor over his head will be the player to receive the pass attempt.
♦ The Kick Meter at the top of the screen indicates your kicking strength. The higher your strength, the farther the ball
will fly.
Defence
♦ Use A to select the player you want to control.
♦ Make a diving tackle by pressing B. A diving tackle will stop any player, no matter how big he is!
♦ As you close in on the ball-carrier to make the tackle, there may be an opposing player there to block you. Press
A repeatedly to shed the blocker if you are being blocked.
