Mountain: the lair of Ganon,

The vast land of Hyrule is comprised of a large, open overworld, with underworld dungeons scattered throughout. You must explore this overworld to discover the entrances to the underworld dungeons.
If you touch an enemy or are hit by an enemy attack, your heart meter will go down. If you run out of hearts, it's game over.
