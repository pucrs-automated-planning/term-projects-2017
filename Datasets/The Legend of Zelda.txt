￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼You must collect the eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom to enter Death
Mountain: the lair of Ganon,
Prince of Darkness. You must defeat him and rescue the Princess Zelda!
The vast land of Hyrule is comprised of a large, open overworld, with underworld dungeons scattered throughout. You must explore this overworld to discover the entrances to the underworld dungeons.
If you touch an enemy or are hit by an enemy attack, your heart meter will go down. If you run out of hearts, it's game over.
