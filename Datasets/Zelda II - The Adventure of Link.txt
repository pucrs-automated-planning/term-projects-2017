￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼3 Basic Play
￼￼Guide Link through Hyrule, defeat the guardians of the six palaces and set crystals in the statues you find there. Once your mission is complete, journey to the Valley of Death, defeat the final guardian and recover the Triforce of Courage.
● Basic Rules
Link will take damage and
lose life points when hit by
enemies or enemy attacks. If
all of his life points are drained, he will lose one life. If he loses all his lives, it will be game over. When you restart you'll begin from the North Castle.
● About Levels
Link gains experience points
by defeating enemies. Once
he earns a certain number of
points, he can raise his attack, magic or life points one level. When it is game over, his experience points will revert back to zero.
