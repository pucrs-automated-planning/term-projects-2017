￼￼WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY/SEIZURES
A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights. Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a television screen or when playing video games may trigger epileptic seizures or blackouts in these individuals. These conditions may trigger previously undetected epileptic symptoms or seizures in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy. If you, or anyone in your family, has an epileptic condition or has had seizures of any kind, consult your physician before playing. IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE use and consult your physician before resuming gameplay if you or your child experience any of the following health problems or symptoms:
• dizziness
• altered vision
• eye or muscle twitches
• loss of awareness
• disorientation
• seizures, or
• any involuntary movement or convulsion.
RESUME GAMEPLAY ONLY ON APPROVAL OF YOUR PHYSICIAN. _____________________________________________________________________________
Use and handling of video games to reduce the likelihood of a seizure
• Use in a well-lit area and keep as far away as possible from the television screen.
• Avoid large screen televisions. Use the smallest television screen available.
• Avoid prolonged use of the PLAYSTATION®3 system.
Take a 15-minute break during each hour of play.
• Avoid playing when you are tired or need sleep. _____________________________________________________________________________
Stop using the system immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: lightheadedness, nausea, or a sensation similar to motion sickness; discomfort or pain in the eyes, ears, hands, arms, or any other part of the body. If the condition persists, consult a doctor.
WARNING TO OWNERS OF PROJECTION TELEVISIONS:
Do not connect your PLAYSTATION®3 system to a projection TV without first consulting the user manual for your projection TV, unless it is of the LCD type. Otherwise, it may permanently damage your TV screen.
HANDLING YOUR PLAYSTATION®3 FORMAT DISC:
• Do not bend it, crush it or submerge it in liquids.
• Do not leave it in direct sunlight or near a radiator or other source of heat.
• Be sure to take an occasional rest break during extended play.
• Keep this disc clean. Always hold the disc by the edges and keep it in its protective case

City Map
Press ≥ at any time while in the city to access the City Map. The City Map is a useful tool to orient Spider-Man in Manhattan and find a path toward a specific point. The on-screen controls describe how to cycle through different points of interest, zoom in and out, and move the cursor around to different locations. Use the directional buttons to switch the markers on the map between Missions, Activities and Crime Fighting levels. Once you have selected a point of interest, press the ≈ button and a marker will appear on your screen to guide you to it.
Pause Menu Screens
Press ÷ to access the Pause Menu while playing Spider-Man 3.TM Press the å and ∂ buttons to cycle between screens in the Pause Menu.
Game Summary
This sub-menu shows your progress through the game. Here you can also view the crime level in the city, number of tokens collected and gameplay statistics and manually save the game.
Extras
You can access unlocked extra content in this menu, such as Endurance Arenas.
Upgrades
Here you can see how to perform any upgrades you have unlocked as well as select any extra playable characters you have earned.
Options
This menu allows you to adjust audio options, view your controls and adjust camera controls.
Movement and Camera Control
Use the left stick to move Spider-Man around while on the ground or swinging
in the air. Press the ß button while running to sprint. Use the right stick to manually take control of the camera in Spider-Man 3.TM This can be useful to
4
￼￼look up, down or around Spider-Man, particularly while using Spider-Senses to locate a mission objective or an elusive enemy. Manual camera controls can be adjusted in the Pause Menu.
Swinging
Press the ƒ button to shoot a web and begin to swing. You can also jump before pressing the ƒ button to have some extra height when you start to swing. While swinging, use the left stick to steer Spider-Man in the direction that you want him to go. At any point during the swing, you can shoot out another web and start a new swing by pressing the ƒ button again.
A good way to have greater control over Spider-Man’s movement is to jump out of a swing by pressing the ≈ button. After jumping out of the swing press the ƒ button to shoot out another web and start your next swing. Also, charging a jump by holding the ≈ button for a couple of seconds before releasing it will give you a bigger speed boost as you release your web.
At any point, while swinging, you can also press the ß button to get an extra speed boost. Boosting has a greater effect at the bottom of
a swing.
Frequent use and practice of these techniques will get Spider-Man moving across Manhattan in record time!
comBAt
Spider-Man 3TM has an easy-to-use yet in-depth combo system that takes full advantage of Spider-Man’s inherent speed, strength and web abilities. Use a combination of the √, ç and Ω buttons to unleash a huge variety of combos on your enemies. You can also use the jump button to take combat to the air and perform devastating air assaults. Using the Ω button from a distance will also allow you to perform web moves on your opponents. Using the Ω button when close to enemies will allow you to grab them and perform grapple moves.
Spider-Reflexes – When a yellow or red danger icon appears above an enemy’s head, activate Spider-Reflexes by pressing the å button to dodge the incoming attack. Spider-Reflexes slows down the world around you and
5
￼￼can be very helpful in combat and puzzle situations. Dodging the attacks of most enemies, even bosses, can leave them open to counter attacks, so be sure to use Spider-Reflexes during battle. The blue bar in your HUD measures how much reflex power you have remaining.
Super Moves – The red combo meter in the upper left corner of the screen will fill up as you perform successful attacks on enemies. Once it is full, you can execute any of the super attacks you have unlocked by pressing the ∂ button and the appropriate attack button.
Combat Upgrades – As you progress through the story in Spider-Man 3,TM you will unlock new combat maneuvers that will help Spider-Man conquer his foes. Pay attention to these upgrades as they can be useful tools against some of the more difficult encounters that Spider-Man will face.
On the next page you’ll find a list of some of the basic combos you start the game with. Look in the upgrades tab of the Pause Menu to view the upgrades you earn during gameplay.
GEnErAl inFormAtion
Health, Spider-Reflexes and Combo Meter – The icon in the upper left corner of the screen displays Spider-Man’s Health and Spider-Reflexes reserve. As Spider-Man takes damage, the red bar will decrease. The blue bar represents Spider-Man’s reflexes. As he uses this superpower, the bar will decrease until he can no longer stay in his heightened Spider-Reflex state. The center of the icon is your Combo meter and will fill up with each successful attack on an enemy. Once your Combo meter is full, you can use a super attack. When controlling Black-Suited Spider-Man with your Combo meter full, you can enter Rage mode for a short period of time.
Chase Meter – The Chase meter shows how far away Spider-Man is to the chase target. Don’t fall too far behind or you will fail the mission. Don’t follow targets too close if you are trying to be stealthy. The closer the spider is to the right side of the screen, the closer you are to your target.

BY OPENING THIS PACKAGE, AND/OR USING THE PROGRAM, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE WITH ACTIVISION, INC. ("ACTIVISION").
LIMITED USE LICENSE. Activision grants you the non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right and license to use one copy of this Program solely and exclusively for your personal use. All rights not specifically granted under this Agreement are reserved by Activision. This Program is licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in this Program and should not be construed as a sale of any rights in this Program.

All title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to this Program and any and all copies thereof (including but not limited to any titles, computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialog, catch phrases, locations, concepts, artwork, animation, sounds, musical compositions, audio-visual effects, methods of operation, moral rights, and any related documentation, incorporated into this Program) are owned by Activision or its licensors. This Program is protected by the copyright laws of the United States, international copyright treaties and conventions and other laws. This Program contains certain licensed materials and Activision’s licensors may protect their rights in the event of any violation of this Agreement.
YOU SHALL NOT:
• Exploit this Program or any of its parts commercially, including but not limited to use at a cyber cafe, computer gaming center or any other location-based site.

LIMITED WARRANTY. Activision warrants to the original consumer purchaser of this Program that the recording medium on which the Program is recorded will be free from defects in material and workmanship for 90 days from the date of purchase. If the recording medium is found defective within 90 days of original purchase, Activision agrees to replace, free of charge, any product discovered to be defective within such period upon its receipt of the Product, postage paid, with proof of the date of purchase, as long as the Program is still being manufactured by Activision. In the event that the Program is no longer available, Activision retains the right to substitute a similar program of equal or greater value. This warranty is limited to the recording medium containing the Program as originally provided by Activision and is not applicable to normal wear and tear. This warranty shall not be applicable and shall be void if the defect has arisen through abuse, mistreatment, or neglect. Any implied warranties prescribed by statute are expressly limited to the 90-day period described above.
EXCEPT AS SET FORTH ABOVE, THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND NO OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR CLAIMS OF ANY KIND SHALL BE BINDING ON OR OBLIGATE ACTIVISION.
When returning the Program for warranty replacement please send the original product disks only in protective packaging and include: (1) a photocopy of your dated sales receipt; (2) your name and return address typed or clearly printed; (3) a brief note describing the defect, the problem(s) you are encountered and the system on which you are running the Program; (4) if you are returning the Program after the 90-day warranty period, but within one year after the date of purchase, please include check or money order for $20 U.S. currency per disc replacement.

LIMITATION ON DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL ACTIVISION BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM POSSESSION, USE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING DAMAGES TO PROPERTY, LOSS OF GOODWILL, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES, EVEN IF ACTIVISION HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACTIVISION’S LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ACTUAL PRICE PAID FOR THE LICENSE TO USE THIS PROGRAM. SOME STATES/COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS AND/OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND/OR EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.
TERMINATION. Without prejudice to any other rights of Activision, this Agreement will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with its terms and conditions. In such event, you must destroy all copies of this Program and all of its component parts.
U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The Program and documentation have been developed entirely at private expense and are provided as "Commercial Computer Software" or "restricted computer software." Use, duplication or disclosure by the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government subcontractor is subject to the restrictions set forth in subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clauses in DFARS 252.227-7013 or as set forth in subparagraph (c)(1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Software Restricted Rights clauses at FAR 52.227-19, as applicable. The Contractor/ Manufacturer
is Activision, Inc., 3100 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica, California 90405.
INJUNCTION. Because Activision would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, you agree that Activision shall be entitled, without bond, other security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as Activision may otherwise have under applicable laws.
INDEMNITY. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Activision, its partners, affiliates, contractors, officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from
all damages, losses and expenses arising directly or indirectly from your acts and omissions to act in using the Product pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning this license between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between them. It may be amended only by a writing executed by both parties. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable
for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not
be affected. This Agreement shall be construed under California law as such law is applied to agreements between California residents entered into and to be performed within California, except as governed by federal law and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Los Angeles, California.
